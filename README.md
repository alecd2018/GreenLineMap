<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project uses a RaspberryPi computer to pull live train data from the MBTA's API, and display it on a set of LED lights. Currently, the project is configured to display *only* the Green Line C route. See the video above for its various modes. Using a button, a user can alternate between the following modes:
* Trains (default): displays live train locations on the Green Line.
* Party: Showcases the usage of the WS2812B lights by playing with the colors
* Off: Pauses the program until another button press

Follow the steps below for cloning and running a local copy.

### Built With

#### Hardware
* [RaspberryPi 4B]()
* [WS2812B individually addressable LED strip]()
* Custom wood frame

#### Software
* [Anaconda Python](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. *Note*: the following steps are for running a local demo of the live map *without* the RaspberryPi and LEDs. Since the LED's require an extra library, please use the **demo** branch for this section.

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following software:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): I used [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- **Optional**: The following parts are what I used for building the display. 
  - RaspberyPi and Power Supply
  - WS2812B LED Light strip
  - Wood, paint, and other miscellaneous materials.


### Installation

Copy and paste the following script into your terminal to run the installation.
  ```sh
  # Clone the repo
  git clone https://github.com/alecdean/green-line-map.git
  cd green-line-map

  # Create and launch virtual conda environment
  conda create -n mbta python=3.7
  conda activate mbta

  # Install dependent libraries
  pip install flask requests
  ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run a local copy *with no LED lights*, run the following:

```
conda activate mbta
python main.py
```
